                autonomous academic units bound together within a single institution. Each micro-college
                is self-governing, with its own identity, faculty, and traditions, yet all share a
                unified curriculum and digital infrastructure that binds the network into one coherent

                Unlike the monolithic departments of traditional universities, Artemis micro-colleges
                are intimate scholarly communities — small enough that every student is known by name,
                yet large enough in collective ambition to rival any institution on Earth. They are the
                living embodiment of the ancient collegial ideal: a guild of scholars living and
                learning together.

                Each micro-college selects and admits its own students, provides housing and communal
                life, and delivers the close personal tutorial mentorship that defines the Artemis
                educational experience. Together, they form the human backbone of the University.
