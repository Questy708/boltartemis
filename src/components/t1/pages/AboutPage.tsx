           <p>The Artemis Project was sparked by a fundamental question: what if the entire architecture of higher education was redesigned for the 21st century and beyond? While institutions around the world were experimenting at the margins — adding online courses, updating curricula, launching innovation labs — the Artemis Project asked whether the very foundations of the university needed reimagining.</p>
           <p>Recognizing the advent of the &apos;Homo Eruditus&apos; — the learned and adaptable human — the project sought to transition from archaic, Industrial Revolution-era educational models to dynamic, cross-disciplinary, and globally collaborative frameworks accessible to all. The project drew on insights from hundreds of students, faculty, administrators, and visionaries across multiple continents, combining design thinking, futures methodology, and rigorous academic research.</p>
           <p>The project included intensive design workshops, global research expeditions, and the development of tools to support individuals who share the goal of experimenting towards a future of education that serves all of humanity. Design work continued for over a year, creating the foundation for the Artemis 2100 exhibit, which debuted as an immersive, globally accessible experience staged as a time-travel journey — dimensions designed not as predictions, but as invitations to experiment.</p>

           <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">The Artemis 2100 exhibit presented six dimensions — each a window into a possible future where a different dimension of the university was reimagined. Together, they formed a complete vision: rhythm (Infinite Learning Continuum), pace (Adaptive Paced Learning), identity (SkillPrints), commitment (The Artemis Oath), place (Centers of Inquiry), and movement (The World as Campus).</p>
